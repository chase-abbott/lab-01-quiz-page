        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p>
             Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grape juice.
             Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. 
             Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. 
             These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the production process.
             Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. 
             These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. 
             Wines not made from grapes involve fermentation of additional crops, including rice wine and other fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, currant and elderberry.

        <ul>
            <li>Cabernet Sauvignon</li>
            <li> Pinot Noir </li>
            <li> Chardonnay </li>
            <li> Pinot Gris </li>
            <li> Syrah </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Red Wine </h3>
        <p>The red-wine production process involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. 
            Red wine is made from dark-colored grape varieties. 
            The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines, 
            through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. 
            The juice from most purple grapes is actually greenish-white;
             the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) 
             present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier
             varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.
        </p>
        <h3> White Wine </h3>
        <p>Fermentation of the non-colored grape pulp produces white wine. 
            The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow.
             Some varieties are well-known, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling.
              Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are examples of these. 
             Dark-skinned grapes may be used to produce white wine if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. 
             Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.</p>
